The SQL script table_creation.sql creates a set of tables to hold and then imports employee data for a fictional company. The SQL script employee_data_analysis.sql then runs through a list of queries that analyzes and compares the data in various ways. The entity relationship diagram png for the tables can be found in the EmployeeSQL folder under employee_sql_ERD_correct.png.
